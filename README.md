# MIPS Single-Cycle CPU Implementation

This project is a course design for **Computer Composition Principles** at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Nantong University. The aim was to design, simulate, and test a single-cycle CPU based on the MIPS architecture.

## Purpose

1. **Strengthen Understanding of Computer Systems**  
   This project helps students build a solid foundation in the principles of computer organization. By applying practical concepts, students gain insights into how different components of a computer interact, emphasizing the concepts of "time and space" in computing.

2. **Improve Design, Problem-Solving, and Teamwork Skills**  
   Students gain hands-on experience in designing and troubleshooting computer systems, enhancing their ability to conduct independent research and solve complex problems. This project also promotes teamwork by preparing students to work effectively in groups, take on leadership roles, and independently complete assigned tasks.
